My first solo exhibition, held in Jeddah, where I displayed 30 unique artworks illustrating Quranic verses. By utilizing skilfull imagery and transforming  them into timeless pieces by combining delicate deewani script with  visual tafseer and different art styles. The 3-day event garnered lots of local artistsâ€™ attention and support, all of whom admired my creativity and effort.
