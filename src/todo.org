   Ar Raad:28
       The ups and downs of our ECG are combined with the beautiful ayaat that
       says "Verily, only through remembrance of Allah do hearts find peace".
** DONE Add Description for painting "Enchanting Deception"
   Al Hadeed:20 
       Beautiful bubbles are shown in various colors and sizes, they are all
       mesmerizing with colorful sunshine dancing on their surfaces. Our Earth
       with all its beauty is amongst them. Its colors and attractions make us
       forget that delight of the bubble is very brief and short lived.
	   "The life of this world is nothing but enjoyment of vanity".
** TODO Add Description for painting "Eternal Remorse"
   UNKNOWN:
       This painting illustrates utter despair and regret. When the skeleton was

       futile display of repentance serves as a warning to fully avail the
       opportunity of earning Akhira in our lifetime.

   Al Baqara:286
       This tree facing the sky is in all prayers to Allah (SWT). "Our lord! Do
       not burden us with more than we have strength to bear, and pardon us and
       forgive us and have mercy on us".

       spreading their wings and holding them? None holds them except the
       Compassionate. He is the perceiver of everything."
** DONE Add Description for painting "Nebula"
   Al e Imran:47
      Countless nebulas exist in outer space, new stars are created all the time

      "Be" and it becomes.
** DONE Add Description for painting "Inconceivable Ingenuity"

       of Allah (SWT) would not be exhausted indeed"
